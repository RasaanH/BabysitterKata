# BabysitterKata
I was asked to build a react native application that helps a babysitter calculate how much she will earn on a night given different hourly rates for different time windows.

# Running the Project
This project was built with the react native CLI quickstart, not using expo - https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.66/environment-setup?guide=native

Run `npm install` then `npx react-native start` and finally `npx react-native run-android` to start the app in an android emulator locally, assuming you have an emulator already set up on your system.
